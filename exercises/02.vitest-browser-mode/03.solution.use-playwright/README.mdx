# Use Playwright

0. Explain why we want `playwright` and not the default `preview` browser provider (works better for CI, more powerful since it taps into the Chrome DevTools Protocol).
1. Install `playwright`.
1. Run `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium` and configure your repo so this runs automatically (this can be quite annoying). Also, install just the browsers we need, not all of them, to save time on CI.
1. Update the Vitest configuration to use `playwright` as the browser automation tool.
