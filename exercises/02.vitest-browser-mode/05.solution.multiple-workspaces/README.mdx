# Multiple workspaces

Problem: you may have unit tests and browser (integration) tests in the same project using Vitest.

1. Update `vite.config.ts` to include multiple [`workspaces`](https://main.vitest.dev/guide/workspace.html#configuration): one for unit tests, another for browser tests.
1. Update TypeScript configs so different test patterns have different types (unit tests have no business accessing browser types).
1. Update `package.json` with `test:unit` and `test:integration` scripts. Show how to run different workspaces from the CLI.
1. Install `@types/node` for unit tests.
1. List different strategies for separating tests: base on filename, base on directory.
