# Accessibility selectors

Now that we have MSW set up, let's write some tests for the Discount code form! For that, we will need to select elements and interact with them just like our users would.

- Why accessibility selectors matter?
- Why not `test-id`?
- Implicit benefits of selectors (validate the accessibility of your markup; you cannot force your way to things the user cannot "see" on the page)
- Show how to see if an element has an _accessible name_. You can use Chrome devtools for that.
