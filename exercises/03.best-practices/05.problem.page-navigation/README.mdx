# Page navigation

- **[ ] TODO: Make the discount code form access something from the router.**

Components in your application don't exist in isolation. They are likely a part of a larger page that lives at a certain _route_. Whether you are building a Single Page Application, or a Multi-Page Application, or even a Statically Generated Site, you are unlikely to escape routing.

What interest us from the testing perspective here is that components can _access router data_ and _navigate to other routes_. Both of those have to be accounted for during automated tests.

While you were gone, I've added some routing to our application with React Router. The `<DiscountCodeForm />` now belongs to a certain route and contains a link to the Cart page. As usual, the best way for you to learn how to test this is through writing some tests!

üë®‚Äçüíº Head to the <InlineFile file="./src/discount-code-form.browser.test.tsx">`discount-code-form.browser.test.tsx`</InlineFile> where you will have two tasks:

1. Refactor the existing tests by introducing a custom `wrapper` that makes it possible for our router-dependent component to render in isolation;
1. Finish the newly added test case for the "Back to cart" link.

See you once you're done!
