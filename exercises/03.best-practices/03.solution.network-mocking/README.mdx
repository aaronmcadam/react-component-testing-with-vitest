# Network mocking

Problem: performing requests to an actual server makes your test dependent on the operability of that server, among other things. Instead, mock the network in your component tests using MSW.

Mocking APIs is a part of the _setup_ so it makes sense we start from it. It unblocks proper testing in the future exercises.

**Focus on MSW integration only. We are writing tests in the next exercise.**

## Steps

1. Install `msw`.
1. Init the worker script.
1. Create `/mocks/handlers.ts` with happy-path handlers, and `/mocks/browser.ts` with the worker.
1. Create a custom _test context_ in the `test-extend.ts` file. Don't forget about `auto` to enable MSW even when it's not referenced in the test! (to rely on happy path handlers)
