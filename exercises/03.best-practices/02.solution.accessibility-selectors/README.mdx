# Accessibility selectors

Problem: don't riddle your code with implementation details like `data-testId`. Select elements on the page like the user would actually see themâ€”using the ARIA roles.

- We've already used `page.getByText('file.txt')` in our test, which is great! Let's explore more accessible selectors you can use when testing your React components.

A **form** should work nicely:

- `.getByRole('heading')` for the form section heading on the page.
- `.getByLabelText()` for inputs.
- `.getByRole('button')` (again) for the submit button, but this time the button's text is broken by a visual element (an icon).
- `.getByText()` for the submit success message to showcase selecting generic text on the page.

Best practices:

- Avoid `.getByTestId()`
- Prefer `.getByLabelText()` vs `.getByPlaceholder()`
