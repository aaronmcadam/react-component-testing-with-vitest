# User events

We've already explored some user events, like `.fill()` and `.click()`, but there's more.

- [ ] Maybe change the component so it allows for a different typing flow? Showcase `.keyboard()`? `.drapAndDrop()` to drop the discount code?

- `.selectOptions()` to work with `<select>`.
- `.keyboard()` for complex keyboard flows (e.g. shortcuts).
