# Best practices

Tools are important. But the most important things often transcend tools. Tools can give you a solid foundation but it's still _your task_ to write great tests.

In this exercise block, we will go through some of the absolutely essential best practices when it comes to writing integration tests. I've already spoken a lot about the [true purpose of testing](https://www.epicweb.dev/the-true-purpose-of-testing), [what makes a great test](https://www.epicweb.dev/the-golden-rule-of-assertions), and why you want to [write tests that fail](https://www.epicweb.dev/writing-tests-that-fail). All of those still apply. Today, I would like to add another layer onto the onion of your test quality. Today, let's talk about how to achieve fantastic integration tests.

## What we will cover

There's countless practices, patterns, and pieces of advices when it comes to testing. Some general, others extremely specific. For this block, I've trimmed all of those down to the following topics:

1. **Accessibility selectors**. Write tests that find HTML elements the same way your users find them.
1. **User events**. Write tests that interact with HTML elements the same way your users do.
1. **Network mocking**. How to mock network requests in your tests with [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/).
1. **Element presence**. How to test elements presence, especially when something must _not_ appear in the UI.
1. **Page navigation**. Testing page transition (i.e. routing) on the integration level.

If you nail these five, you already establish a strong starting point for the quality of your tests. I think it's time we explored them.
