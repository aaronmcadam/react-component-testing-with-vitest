# Page navigation

...

## Why not test the navigation?

- Not reliable on the integration level anywhere. There may be other elements rendered in the router tree that can affect how the pages render or even whether some elements on the page are interactive (imagine a random component rendering an `opacity:0` overlay over the "Back to cart" button. It's broken now!).
- Clear responsibilities. Clear boundaries. The Golden Rule of Assertion.

## When to test the navigation

- E2E tests as a part of some user flows. Navigation would act as the implied assertion there, which is fantastic.
