# Debugger

1. Explain why a usual debugger won't cut it (two different threads: node and browser).
1. Create a Visual Studio Code `launch` config.
1. Showcase how to run Vitest from the launch task.

## Steps

1. Create `.vscode/launch.json`.
1. Modify `vite.config.ts` to set `headless` based on the `process.env.DEBUG` variable. We want to see the browser while debugging, but we don't need to while running the tests normally.
1. Complete the instructions in the test suite (set a debugger).
1. Run the tests via the "Debug Vitest Browser" command in the IDE.
