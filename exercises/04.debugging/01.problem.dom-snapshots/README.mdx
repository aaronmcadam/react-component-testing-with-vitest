# DOM snapshots

Your component tests consist of two parts:

- A rendered UI;
- Test actions interacting with that UI.

While you can observe and analyze certain actions in a test, it's a bit tricker when it comes to debugging the rendered markup. For once, your UI components are not a 1-1 representation of the final DOM. There can be side effects and user actions that result in the elements appearing or disappearing on the page. Looking at the component's code alone won't cut it.

Sometimes you just need to take a look at the current state of the DOM _during_ the test. This is where DOM snapshots come in!

üë®‚Äçüíº In this exercise, your task is to **track down and fix a nasty bug** that found its way in the code. To do that, you will observe the rendered markup as it changes from the test actions, using a `debug()` utility function. Complete the instructions in the `debug.browser.test.tsx` test suite and have the tests passing.

This is where taking _spapshots_ comes in handy. At any point of your test, you can take a look at the current state of the DOM to see if it's what you expect it to be. You can do that by calling the `debug()` utility function returned from `render()`:

```tsx
const { debug } = render(<p>Hello world</p>)
debug()
```

```html
<body>
	<p>Hello world</p>
</body>
```

- How to use `debug()` from `render()`.
- You can debug the entire rendered tree by calling `debug()`.
- You can debug a subportion of the tree but calling `debug(locator)` or even an array of locators.
